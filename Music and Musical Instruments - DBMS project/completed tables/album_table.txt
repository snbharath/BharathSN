late summer of 2002,introducing audiences to their world of what many referred to as "space-rock".Using space imagery highly metaphorically throughout 
each track, 30STM earned a name for themselves touring with many well-known acts such as Incubus (I actually picked up their album to check them out about 
a month before I was seeing them with Incubus in Detroit.)','A Beautiful Lie is the second album by American rock band 30 Seconds to Mars.A Beautiful Lie 
differs notably from the bands self-titled debut album, both musically and lyrically. Whereas the eponymous concept albums lyrics focus on human struggle 
and astronomical themes,A Beautiful Lies lyrics are "personal and less cerebral."And the musictakes on a youthful, more post-hardcore approach by 
introducing intense screaming vocals and deemphasizing synth effects.','16-Aug-2005');

well placed.A Thousand Suns isnt quite the return to the magic of debut album Hybrid Theory, as it has been billed in some quarters, but neither is it 
a straight re-enactment of the turgid attempt at a stadium-filler that was 2007s Minutes to Midnight.Musically, A Thousand Suns is more intricately put 
together than any of the bands previous releases, even the ultimately superior Hybrid Theory.','A Thousand Suns is the fourth studio album by American 
rock band Linkin Park.The style of the album has been compared to the music of Pink Floyd and contains the high pitched sonar "ping" from Echoes at the 
end of "Robot Boy" and continuing into "Jornada del Muerto".A Thousand Suns is a concept album dealing with human fears such as nuclear warfare.It has 
also been stated that the album honors the hip-hop group Public Enemy.','14-sep-2010');

Foxtrot.','American Idiot is the seventh studio album by the American punk rock band Green Day.They decided to produce a rock opera, inspired by the work 
of The Who and numerous musicals. It follows the life of "Jesus of Suburbia", a sort of anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong.In late 2005, Dean Gray
